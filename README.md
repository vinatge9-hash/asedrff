# Resto Mash - Website Package

This repository contains a modern, sleek 5-page restaurant website for "Resto Mash" built with Tailwind CSS classes directly in HTML.

Pages included:
- index.html (Home)
- about.html (About Us)
- menu.html (Menu)
- gallery.html (Gallery)
- contact.html (Contact Us)

All pages use semantic HTML, responsive navigation with a mobile hamburger, a full-viewport hero on the Home page, and a consistent three-column footer. Tailwind CDN is used for styling. Image placeholders follow the required format.

 Footer contains a dark background, 3-column layout on desktop, and responsive stacking on mobile. Interactive elements include hover and focus states with smooth transitions (transition-all duration-300, etc.). The body fades in on load, and sections reveal on scroll via a simple IntersectionObserver.

Location used for placeholder data: Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Copyright year used: 2025.

If you’d like any copy tweaks, dish names, or imagery changes, tell me what to adjust and I’ll update the build.
